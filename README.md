# Javascript Basics

I've created this document to bring together what I believe to be the most important concepts for developing a foundational knowledge of JavaScript. It is not an exhaustive list as my goal is for you to be able to read through it in roughly 10 - 15 minutes. 

So let's dig in.

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that can run both in a browser and (more recently) on a server. It was written to run in the Netscape browser in 1995. JavaScript can update and change our HTML and CSS, calculate and manipulate data and request and receive data from servers or other websites. 

### Data types
Data types are a concept that is common across all programming languages. In JavaScript there are 7 primitive (basic) data types:

#### Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. A string literal is a sequence surrounded by either single or double quotes.

    > ‘Stringy string string’ 
    > “How’s ya bloody string mate”

A string literal can also be so-called template literals (introduced into JS in ES6).

#### Numbers

A number can be either a positive or negative integer or a positive or negative decimal (floating point number).

    > 1
    > -13
    > 7.849
    > -934.379

#### Booleans
A boolean represents a value of true or false.

    > true
    > false

#### Null
`null` is just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

#### Undefined
Not to be confused with null, the meaning of `undefined` is “value is not assigned”.

#### Symbols
Symbols are new in the latest version of JavaScript (ES6). A symbol is a unique identifier whose value is its description. Two Symbols with the exact same description are not equal. Symbols are used when a completely unique value is needed. Sounds confusing? Well it bloody is and 
  

-   Truthy/Falsey
-   Type coercion

-   Variables

-   Let vs. Const. vs. Var

-   Variable name is its name. It can be any string that is not a reserved word.
-   A variable or constant can be initialised with a value or with an undefined value like so: let newVariable;

-   Operators
-   Functions

-   Scope and the ‘this’ keyword

-   Conditionals
-   Loops
-   Math
-   Methods

-   String
-   Array
-   Object

-   Events
-   DOM manipulation
